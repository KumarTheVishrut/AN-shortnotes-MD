## üîÅ **Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB)**

**Definition:**  
A protocol designed for **Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)** that ensures **fair, high-speed access** to a shared network using a dual bus structure.

- **IEEE 802.6 standard**
- Distance: Up to **30 miles (48 km)**
- Speed: **55 Mbps**

---

### üìä **Key Concepts of DQDB**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Dual Bus** | Two unidirectional buses running in opposite directions. |
| **Distributed Queue** | Each node manages its own queue to request access to the bus. |
| **Fair Access** | Ensures all nodes get a fair chance to transmit. |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How DQDB Works**

1. **Topology**  
   - Each node is connected to both buses.
   - Buses run parallel and in opposite directions.

2. **Data Transmission**  
   - Nodes monitor one bus and transmit on the other.
   - Transmission is controlled using distributed counters to avoid collisions.

3. **Distributed Queue**  
   - Nodes count upstream requests.
   - This info helps manage access in a decentralized way.

---

### ‚úÖ **Advantages of DQDB**

- Fair access for all nodes.
- Efficient for **large-scale MANs**.
- Scalable for many users.

---

### ‚ùå **Limitations of DQDB**
